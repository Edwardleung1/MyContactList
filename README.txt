My Contact List app in JavaScript without any library or JS framework, just using ES6 classes, local storage and more.

In this project I built a one page layout with a contact form consisting of 3 input fields. It will check and validate the data the user enters.

Then store the data into local storage and it allows the user to delete the contact as well which alerts them with a message on screen on the UI.

I have learned a lot by using ES6 classes and some arrow functions. Also this project taught me how to manipulate the DOM using template literal and grabbing certain elements. 

First time using local storage to store data which was kind of fun. It is also responsive on smaller devices so that it works on all devices with different screen sizes.
